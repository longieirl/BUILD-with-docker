### Introduction
This repo will configure the SAP BUILD application using a three node MongoDB replica set. BUILD is based on the MEAN stack so the
entire stack is exposed via Docker containers with a central data store for managing logs and data between ALL MongoDB nodes.

Reference: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/replication-introduction/

### Overview of BUILD
BUILD is an open-source, cloud-based and social platform that enables users, even those with no UI development knowledge, to easily create fully interactive prototypes with realistic data, share them with colleagues and consolidate this feedback without writing a line of code.

Reference: https://github.com/SAP/BUILD

### Prerequisites
- Currently tested on OS X and Ubuntu 14.04
- boot2docker 1.7 (OS X) or docker (Ubuntu) is installed and available from the cli
- git is installed and available from the cli
- MongoDB 2.6.* / 3.0.*
- NPM 1.4.* / 2.11.*
- The following ports are available on your host
```
9000 - BUILD App
27017 - MongoDB
```
Note: the scripts can be configured to use different ports if required
- setup.sh script will automatically add the ports to your boot2docker vm ```boot2docker-vm``` assuming you haven't changed the default boot2docker vm name

### Remote Install
Download and install in one go!

```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longieirl/build-with-docker/master/remoteSetup.sh | bash
```
Note: this entire process can take up to 10-15mins depending on network connection and CPU power....be patient!

### Local Install - Step 1
- Clone the setup repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/longieirl/build-with-docker.git build-with-docker
```

- Change into setup directory and clone BUILD
```
$ cd build-with-docker
$ git clone https://github.com/SAP/BUILD.git BUILD
```

### Local Install - Step 2
This setup will build the Docker images locally, build distribution folder and then run BUILD

- Run setup to install MongoDB Replica set and BUILD
```
$ ./setup.sh
```
Note: you may need to run this one or twice if you experience any of the errors below. Until BUILD is bumped to the latest version of NodeJS and NPM this is a problem.

### Local Install - Step 3

- Login
Open URL using Chrome, the recommended browser for SAP BUILD
```
http://localhost:9000/login
```
Note: if the server does not come up, watch the logs to see what is happening:
```sh
$ docker logs build-node
```

### Errors
- If you get the following error, just run ./setup.sh again. This is an issue with the version of NPM - all the modules that were previously downloaded will still be availble.
```
path /root/.npm/a58c529b-oot-npm-lodash-2-4-2-package-tgz.lock
```
Note: it can be any package that is locked, this is just one example.

- If you get a node-gyp rebuild error, the install will still work as it will use the JS version instead so this is NOT a blocker! Looking to resolve this issue!
```sh
gyp ERR! configure error 
gyp ERR! stack Error: spawn ENOENT
gyp ERR! stack     at errnoException (child_process.js:1011:11)
gyp ERR! stack     at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:802:34)
gyp ERR! System Linux 4.0.5-boot2docker
gyp ERR! command "node" "/opt/node/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/bin/node-gyp.js" "rebuild"
gyp ERR! cwd /app/node_modules/norman-auth-server/node_modules/x.509
gyp ERR! node -v v0.10.38
gyp ERR! node-gyp -v v1.0.1
gyp ERR! not ok 
npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing x.509@0.1.4
```

- You can ignore this error if the ports are already configured on your virtualbox
```sh
VBoxManage: error: A NAT rule for this host port and this host IP already exists
```

### TODO
- [ ] Better way of managing host names per instance
- [ ] Use docker-swarm for managing docker instances https://github.com/docker/swarm/
- [ ] Use docker-compose for creating containers i.e. using the scale option for the replica creation
- [ ] Automate entire setup using vagrant/fig
- [ ] Stop/start scripts to persist data between container restarts, all data is lost each time setup.sh is run
- [ ] Make the various dockerfiles, scripts etc...more configurable i.e. taking NPM version as a parameter 
- [ ] Hosting this on AWS and other cloud solutions
